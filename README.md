Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This task focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structure, relationships, and potential issues. The insights derived from this analysis will guide further data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.

Objectives
Understand the dataset using summary statistics and visualizations.

Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.

Explore relationships between features.

Prepare the data for subsequent machine learning tasks.

Dataset
Source: Titanic-Dataset.csv

Tools and Libraries Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Jupyter Notebook

EDA Steps Performed:

a) Data Loading and Inspection

Loaded the dataset and checked its structure and types.
Identified missing values and data quality issues.

b) Summary Statistics

Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics for numeric features.

c) Univariate Analysis

Plotted histograms and boxplots to understand the distribution of individual features.
Analyzed categorical variables using bar charts and count plots.

d) Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis

Used pairplots and correlation matrices to explore relationships between features.
Created scatter plots to visualize feature interactions and groupings.

e) Pattern, Trend, and Anomaly Detection

Identified key relationships (e.g., between class and fare, SibSp and age).
Spotted outliers and unusual data points.

f) Feature-Level Inferences

Made basic inferences about the importance and behavior of individual features.

Key Insights: 

Discovered strong and weak relationships between certain features.
Noted imbalances and outliers in the data.
Gained a clear understanding of the dataâ€™s structure, which will inform the next steps.
